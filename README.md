# UGC Comment Insights Miner
> **Cook A Skill Challenge** — Transform comment threads into ready-to-use content sections for your blog.

## What does this skill do?
Takes 1+ URLs (Reddit, X/Twitter, YouTube, forum, blog) → auto-fetches comments → filters noise → classifies insights into 3 categories → analyzes viral patterns → outputs ready-to-paste markdown report for your blog.

## Problem
Content writers spend 1–2 hours per article hunting for and synthesizing community insights. Most skip this step → articles end up generic, lack real human voice, no E-E-A-T signals → rarely cited by AI search engines (Google SGE, Perplexity).

## 3 Insight Categories
| Category | Description | SEO/GEO Value |
|---|---|---|
| **Counter-Arguments** | Opposing viewpoints and alternative perspectives | Multi-perspective = comprehensive hub |
| **Real-World FAQs** | Real questions from the community | Match conversational search + PAA |
| **Personal Experiences** | Case studies from real users | "Experience" in E-E-A-T |

## Before vs. After
| Metric | Before (Manual) | After (With Skill) |
|---|---|---|
| Time | 1–2 hours | 1–2 minutes |
| Comments reviewed | ~30 (skimmed) | 100+ (systematic) |
| Viral analysis | Manual | Automatic |
