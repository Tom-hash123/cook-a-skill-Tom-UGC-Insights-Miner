# Skill Card: UGC Comment Insights Miner

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| **Skill Name** | UGC Comment Insights Miner |
| **What Gets Automated** | Collects, filters, and classifies community insights from comment threads (Reddit, X, YouTube, forums) into ready-to-use content sections for your blog — including counter-arguments, FAQs from real users, personal experiences, and viral pattern analysis |
| **BEFORE: Manual Process** | Each blog post requires 1–2 hours scrolling Reddit/X/forums, reading hundreds of comments, manually cherry-picking, and rewriting. Most writers skip this step due to time constraints → articles lack UGC depth |
| **AFTER: With Skill** | Paste 1–3 URLs → 1–2 minutes → complete markdown report with 5 sections (Executive Summary, Counter-Arguments, FAQ, Experiences, Viral Analysis) + optional Blog Cross-Reference. Copy-paste directly into blog, edit < 5 minutes |
| **Tools/AI Used** | Claude (SKILL.md prompt engineering), web_fetch (URL fetching), Claude Projects |
| **Limitations** | X/Twitter may block scraping (requires backup Reddit links); JS-rendered comments cannot be fetched; limited to top 100 comments/URL; no scheduled monitoring yet |
| **Expansion Roadmap** | Phase 2: Multi-link batch (5–10 URLs), template variants by blog type, brand voice calibration, DOCX output. Phase 3: Browser extension "X Learning Companion" — smart bookmarks, profile tracker, daily digest |
